# SALES- PRODUCT-ANALYSIS-REPORT
## OBJECTIVES:
The objective is to analyze two years (2023-2024) of sales and customer data, contained within Excel files, with fields including product, region, customer ID, order date, quantity, unit price, and order ID, at monthly and yearly granularity. This analysis will track key performance indicators (total sales, customer growth, regional performance) to derive insights for identifying top-selling products, understanding customer behavior, and optimizing sales strategies.

## DATA ACQUISITION AND PREPARATION:
### Data Extraction:
* I connect Power BI to the relevant data sources.
* I use Power Query Editor to extract and transform the data.
### Data Cleaning:
* I handle missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.
* I standardize data formats for dates.
### Data Transformation:
* I create calculated columns and measures (sales).
* I aggregate data to the desired level of granularity.
### Data Modeling:
* I ensure data integrity and accuracy.

## DASHBOARD DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT (Power BI) :
### Choosing the Right Visualizations:
I use bar charts, line charts, pie charts, maps, and tables to effectively visualize my data.
I select visualizations that are appropriate for the type of data and the insights I want to convey.
### Creating Interactive Elements:
I added slicers,filters and buttons to allow users to explore the data.
I implement drill-down functionality to provide more detailed information (over time series).
I use tooltips to provide more information on data points.
### Designing a User-Friendly Layout:
I organize the dashboard with a clear and logical flow (sales,product and customer segment).
I use consistent formatting and color schemes.
I ensure the dashboard is easy to read and understand.

## KEY DASHBOARD ELEMENTS:
**DashBoard Overview**: Show overall sales performance, including total sales, quantity, product, region and key KPIs.
**Product Analysis**: Visualize sales by product category, top-selling products, and product performance over time.
**Regional Analysis**: Display sales by region, identify top-performing regions, and compare regional performance.
**Customer Analysis**: Analyze customer demographics, identify top customers, and track customer purchasing patterns.
**Time Series Analysis**: Show sales trends over time, identify seasonal patterns, and forecast future sales.

## KEY INSIGHTS:
### Overall Performance & Health:
**Strong Revenue**: The store has generated $11 million in revenue, indicating a healthy business.
**Significant Customer Base**: With 500 customers and a customer lifetime value of $33.53K, the store has a substantial and valuable customer base.
**High Average Order Value**: An average order value of $211.75 suggests customers are spending a significant amount per purchase.

### Time-Based Trends:
**Revenue Fluctuation**: The "Revenue Over Time" chart shows fluctuations, indicating potential seasonality or promotional impacts. Further investigation is needed to determine the causes.
**Quantity Variation**: "Quantity Over Time" mirrors the revenue trend, suggesting sales volume is a key driver of revenue.

### Regional Performance:
**Regional Disparity**: Revenue and quantity vary significantly by region. The "South" region stands out as a high performer, while "West" is the lowest.
**Regional Focus Needed**: Understanding the factors contributing to regional differences is crucial for optimizing sales strategies.

### Product Performance:
**Top-Selling Products**: "Shoes" and "Shirt" are the top revenue generators, while "Hat" and "Gloves" are the lowest.
**Quantity Trends**: "Quantity by Products" shows a similar trend, but the line chart indicates potential trends in sales quantity over time.

### Customer Insights:
**Long Customer Lifespan**: The "Customer Lifespan (Years)" table shows customers have been with the store for an average of 19 years, suggesting high customer loyalty.
**Purchase Frequency**: Customers make purchases relatively frequently, indicating consistent engagement.
**High-Value Customers**: The "Customer Revenue and Quantity by Each Year" table highlights customers with high total sales revenue and quantity. These are likely key accounts.

### Actionable Recommendations:
**Investigate Regional Differences**: Analyze why the "South" region is performing so well and apply those strategies to other regions.
**Focus on Top-Selling Products**: Continue to promote "Shoes" and "Shirts" and explore strategies to boost sales of lower-performing products.
**Maintain Customer Loyalty**: Leverage the long customer lifespan and high purchase frequency by implementing loyalty programs or targeted marketing campaigns.
**Analyze Time-Based Trends**: Investigate the causes of fluctuations in revenue and quantity over time to optimize sales strategies.
**Identify High-Value Customers**: Develop strategies to nurture and retain high-value customers.
